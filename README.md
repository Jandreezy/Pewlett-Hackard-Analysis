## Summary 
Based on the findings of my analysis Pewlett Hackard is potentially facing over 90,000 vacant positions company wide.
Taking into consideration the low amount of employees who are eligible for mentorship, Pewlett hackard will face a great deficit once a majority of eligible employees retire.
